TinaCMS is now fully open-source and easier to self-host. We also built a [Next.js + TinaCMS demo site](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-self-hosted-demo) that can be hosted entirely on Vercel.

Earlier this year, we [released](https://tina.io/blog/self-hosted-datalayer/) the first iteration of the self-hosted TinaCMS backend. The initial [demo](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-self-hosted-demo/tree/274c0d9ee004629ff0cef2539b56c88324abd8f8) relied on Tina Cloud for auth and used MongoDB for the [Data Layer](https://tina.io/blog/self-hosted-datalayer/). That was the first step in helping our users avoid vendor lock-in, but there were limitations, such as requiring a custom auth implementation when not using Tina Cloud and requiring MongoDB for the Data Layer.

We initially released the self-hosted backend under a "source available" license. While this was a very permissive license, we still want developers to feel comfortable building on TinaCMS without fearing that they'll hit a ceiling.

We're excited to announce that TinaCMS's Self-hosted Backend is now open-source, under the Apache 2.0 license!

## Fully self-host TinaCMS on Vercel

To test self-hosting TinaCMS independently of Tina Cloud, we put together a demo site leveraging [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv) for the Data Layer and a built-in auth solution based on [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/). This example demonstrates a fully functioning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site running TinaCMS relying only on GitHub and Vercel.
